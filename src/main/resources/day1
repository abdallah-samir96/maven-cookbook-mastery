- Apache Maven is a popular tool for build automation, primarily Java projects.
- Maven Directories
    - The bin folder contains the batch files and shell scripts to run Maven on various platforms.
    - The boot folder contains the jars required for Maven to start(plexus-classworlds-2.7.0.jar).
    - The conf folder contains the default settings.xml file used by Maven.
    - The lib folder contains the libraries used by Maven. It also contains an ext folder
      in which third-party extensions, which can extend or override the default Maven
      implementation, can be placed.

- When we type mvn command the patch file in the bin directory will be run
- The batch file search about JAVA_HOME and runs its main class {{org.codehaus.plexus.classworlds.launcher.Launcher}}.
- mvn -version to check the version of maven
- Apple provided Java for Mac, but stopped doing so from Java 7 onwards.
- Brew is a popular application on Mac OS X to install open source software.

*************************************
- Changing the JDK of Maven
- set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\devtools\java\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.10.7-hotspot
- mvn -version

- Hence, it is important to ensure JAVA_HOME is defined. In the absence of this variable, Maven
  attempts to detect the presence of Java from PATH. This is typically JRE and not JDK.

- creating our first Maven Project
-- mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.packt.cookbook -DartifactId=simple-project -DarchetypeArtifactId=mavenarchetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
- You can change the groupId and artifactId values in the preceding command as per your requirement.


** Note
- all dependencies and plugins are downloaded and stored into the .m2 folder inside the user
- for example the plugins stored in ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/maven/plugins
- plugins is artifact the same as dependency, its jar file\

There are three types of Maven repositories :
&& Local: This is the repository in your computer filesystem.
&& Remote: This is the repository from where the required Maven files get downloaded.
&& Mirrors: These are repository managers, such as Nexus and Artifactory, that mirror various repositories.


- we can change the location of repository in .m2 folder
    - Set the local repository to your own path in the settings.xml in maven/conf
    - Or create new settings.xml in the .m2 folder and add the following elements
    <settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <localRepository>C:/software/maven</localRepository>
    </settings>
    Here the plugins, dependencies will be stored in the C:/software/maven path instead of m2
- Maven will use settings.xml in the user's .m2 folder, if not found will get the info from the default
  settings.xml, present in the conf folder of the Maven installation.

- Running Maven behind an HTTP proxy server
  - Most organizations do not allow devices in their network to access the Internet directly for
    security and other reasons. In such cases, typically, a proxy server comes into picture. The
    proxy server details are specified in the browser or any other location where access to the
    Internet is required.
  - Create a settings.xml file in the .m2 folder in your HOME directory, if it does not exist already.
  - Add the following code within the settings tag:
    <proxies>
        <proxy>
            <id>myproxy</id>
            <active>true</active>
            <protocol>http</protocol>
            <host>proxy.myorg.com</host>
            <port>8080</port>
            <username>proxyuser</username>
            <password>somepassword</password>
            <nonProxyHosts>*.myorg.com </nonProxyHosts>
        </proxy>
    </proxies>
  - If the proxy server does not need authentication, the username and password tags can be omitted.
  - The nonProxyHosts tag allows you to specify locations that can be accessed directly (for instance, your intranet). This can be skipped if not relevant.
  - Maven needs Internet access to download plugins and dependencies. When Maven runs, it
    reads the user's settings.xml file, if it exists. It checks for any active proxy settings and applies the same.
  - Maven uses the values in the proxy settings to download any artifacts from the repository.
  - The HTTP proxy server may work only in your organization's network, so we can set the <active> tag to false

*******************************************************************
- Understanding the standard directory layout
        - target
            - classes           -> contains the src/main/java compiled classes, src/main/resources files.
            - test-classes      -> contains the src/test/java compiled classes, src/test/resources files.
            - surefire-reports  -> Test reports are separately placed in this folder.
                                   Typically, both XML and HTML report formats are available.
            - The output .jar file: The generated project artifact is also present in this folder.
            - Two other folders—maven-archiver and maven-status—hold information used by Maven during the build.
